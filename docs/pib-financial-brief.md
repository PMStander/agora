# PIB Boardroom Prep: Financial & Pricing Strategy (Feb 13, 2026)

## 1) Market rate benchmarks (South Africa)
**Primary sources (public):**
- **Freelance/contract dev rates:** R500–R1,500/hour cited as typical freelance range (School of IT, 2025). Source: https://www.schoolofit.co.za/software-developer-salary-trends-in-south-africa/
- **App/dev agency hourly:** R650–R950/hour cited for app development agencies (iSolve Mobility, 2025). Source: https://www.isolvemobility.co.za/blog/the-cost-of-app-development/
- **App project budgets:** R150k–R650k common range; broader SA app budgets R45k–R1.25m+ depending on size (iSolve Mobility, 2025). Source: https://www.isolvemobility.co.za/blog/the-cost-of-app-development/
- **Large custom app budgets:** R360k–R1.8m+ depending on platform and scope (Ditstek, 2025). Source: https://www.ditstek.com/blog/app-development-cost-south-africa
- **Salary context:** R300k–R1.5m+ salary bands for devs by seniority (School of IT, 2025). Source: https://www.schoolofit.co.za/software-developer-salary-trends-in-south-africa/
- **General industry hourly (salary-style reporting):** R163.80/hour for software development (PayScale, Jan 2026 — note this reflects employee hourly compensation, not agency bill rates). Source: https://www.payscale.com/research/ZA/Industry=Software_Development/Hourly_Rate

**Implication:** Market bill rates in SA cluster around **R650–R1,500/hour** for experienced freelancers/teams; project budgets **R150k–R650k+** for typical business apps; enterprise work pushes **R750k–R1.8m+**.

## 2) Recommended pricing models (with anchor ranges)
**A) Hourly (best for discovery, integrations, ambiguous scope)**
- **Delivery team rate:** R750–R1,200/hour blended
- **Senior/strategic rate:** R1,200–R1,800/hour
- **AI/ML specialist:** R1,200–R2,000/hour

**B) Project-based (clear scope, predictable outcomes)**
- **MVP / pilot:** R150k–R450k (6–10 weeks)
- **Core product build:** R450k–R1.2m (3–6 months)
- **Enterprise build:** R1.2m–R2.5m+

**C) Retainer (ongoing dev + support + roadmap)**
- **Starter (40–60 hrs/month):** R50k–R90k/month
- **Growth (80–120 hrs/month):** R90k–R160k/month
- **Scale (160+ hrs/month):** R160k–R250k/month

**D) Value-based (when impact is measurable)**
- **% of value created or savings:** 8–15% of annualized ROI
- **Hybrid:** base retainer + success fee (e.g., R80k/month + 10% of verified gains)

**Pricing angle:** Position PIB as a **strategy + build partner** (not just dev). Anchor rates **10–25% above general dev shops** with higher outcome framing.

## 3) Revenue targets (Q1–Q2 2026)
**Assumptions:**
- 1–2 senior builders + 1 product/AI lead + fractional PM
- Average realized rate: **R1,000/hour blended**
- Billable utilization: **55–65%** (bootstrapped, sales + delivery overlap)

**Targets:**
- **Q1 2026 (Jan–Mar):** R600k–R1.1m total
  - Base case: 2 mid-size projects (R250k–R400k each) + 1 small retainer (R60k/month)
- **Q2 2026 (Apr–Jun):** R1.1m–R1.8m total
  - Base case: 1 larger build (R600k–R900k) + 2 retainers (R80k–R120k/month each)

**North Star:** By end of Q2, **R300k–R450k monthly run-rate**.

## 4) Cost structure (indicative ranges)
**AI API costs (usage-dependent):**
- **OpenAI/Anthropic API:** R5k–R50k/month in early-stage usage; spikes to R100k+ with heavy inference or high-volume automation
- **Vector DB / embeddings:** R1k–R8k/month (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant hosted)

**Infrastructure:**
- **Cloud hosting (AWS/Azure/GCP):** R3k–R20k/month (early) depending on workloads
- **CI/CD, monitoring, logs:** R1k–R6k/month (GitHub, Vercel, Sentry, LogDNA, etc.)

**Tools & SaaS:**
- Design/PM/CRM: R2k–R10k/month
- Security/backup/ops: R1k–R5k/month

**People (monthly, gross cost):**
- Senior dev: R70k–R120k
- Mid dev: R45k–R75k
- Fractional PM/ops: R25k–R60k

**Total monthly burn (lean):** **R120k–R250k** (excl. founders)

## 5) Cash flow considerations (bootstrapped)
- **Front-load cash:** 40–60% upfront, 30% mid-milestone, 10–20% on delivery
- **Retainers prepaid:** 1 month upfront + 14-day terms thereafter
- **Scope control:** define change requests as paid add-ons
- **Runway target:** maintain **3–6 months** of core burn in reserve
- **Avoid high-margin mirage:** discount only for longer commitment

## 6) First 3 client acquisition strategy (first revenue)
**Goal:** Land **3 anchor clients** that validate positioning and fund runway.

**Client 1 — Warm network / existing trust**
- Approach: founders’ network, previous clients, referral
- Offer: **“Pilot + roadmap”** (R150k–R250k in 4–6 weeks)
- Value: immediate credibility + quick case study

**Client 2 — Vertical flagship (one industry)**
- Identify 1 sector (e.g., logistics, finance, healthcare)
- Offer: **AI efficiency package** (automation of a painful workflow)
- Pricing: **R250k–R450k** + option to roll into retainer

**Client 3 — Retainer conversion**
- Target ops-heavy SME needing ongoing automation
- Offer: **R80k–R120k/month** retainer with SLA + roadmap + optimization

**Channel mix:**
- Direct founder outreach (10–20 targeted execs)
- Partnerships (agencies needing AI/dev capacity)
- Thought-leadership case study (one sharp demo + ROI story)

---

## Summary: Recommended stance for the boardroom
- **Positioning:** premium “strategy + build” partner
- **Rates:** **R750–R1,800/hr** depending on seniority/AI complexity
- **Projects:** **R150k–R1.2m** core band; enterprise **R1.2m–R2.5m+**
- **Q1–Q2 target:** **R1.7m–R2.9m total**, ramping to **R300k–R450k MRR**
- **Cash discipline:** upfront payments, milestone billing, retainer prepay

If we sail with this map, we stay cash-positive and buy time to build the platform with client-funded momentum.
