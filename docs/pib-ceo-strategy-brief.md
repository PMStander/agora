## 2) Vision Statement Proposal — What PIB Stands For
**“PIB builds reliable, outcome‑driven software and AI systems for South African businesses that need enterprise‑grade results without enterprise overhead.”**

**Core meaning:**
- Outcomes first, not experiments.
- Reliable execution and delivery discipline.
- Local context and responsiveness.
- Lean, high‑trust partnerships.

## 3) Competitive Positioning — South Africa Market
**Position:** Premium, execution‑focused partner between freelancers/cheap agencies and large consultancies.

**Why we win:**
- Faster than big consultancies; more accountable than freelancers.
- Local SA business understanding + modern AI/software stack.
- Founder‑led delivery; small senior team; clear ROI focus.

**Primary competitors:**
- Small dev agencies (price-led, inconsistent quality).
- Big consultancies (slow, expensive, generic).

**PIB claim:** “Senior‑level delivery with local accountability—without the corporate tax.”

## 4) Top 3 Strategic Priorities (Next 90 Days)
1) **Define and package the offer**
   - Clear services menu, outcomes, and pricing anchors.
   - Tight messaging for AI + software build.

2) **Build a credible delivery engine**
   - Standard delivery cadence, QA gate, and handover process.
   - Portfolio case studies (even internal or pilot).

3) **Acquire first anchor clients**
   - Targeted outreach + referrals + local partnerships.
   - Close 2–3 clients with clear ROI stories.

## 5) Key Decisions Needed From This Meeting
1) **Target segment focus** (SMEs, mid‑market, or enterprise pilots?).
2) **Primary offer** (AI automation, custom software, or blended?).
3) **Pricing posture** (value‑based vs time‑based baseline).
4) **Sales motion** (founder‑led only vs shared with team).
5) **Success metric for 90 days** (revenue or pipeline threshold).

## 6) Success Metrics — How We Know We’re On Track
- **Pipeline:** ≥ 30 qualified leads in CRM.
- **Conversion:** ≥ 6 active proposals; ≥ 2 signed deals.
- **Revenue:** First R200k–R500k booked (range depends on deal size).
