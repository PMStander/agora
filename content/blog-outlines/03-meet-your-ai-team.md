## Hook

Our AI marketing head is Alexander the Great. Our CFO is Odysseus. Our CTO is Achilles. Silly? Maybe. But giving AI agents distinct personas turned out to be one of our best product decisions.

## Outline

### 1. The Persona Experiment
- Started as a fun idea: themed teams of historical figures
- Philosophers for personal life, warriors for business
- Each agent has a SOUL.md defining personality, tone, boundaries
- Quick intro to the cast (keep it entertaining)

### 2. Why Personas Actually Matter
- **Specialization signal:** When you talk to "Hippocrates," you know it's health
- **Trust through consistency:** Same personality, same approach, every session
- **Better outputs:** Constrained personas produce more focused responses
- **Emotional connection:** People engage more with characters than generic bots
- Research backing: anthropomorphism in HCI literature

### 3. How We Implement Personas
- SOUL.md: the agent's identity file (personality, tone, boundaries)
- IDENTITY.md: name, emoji, avatar, creature type
- Team hierarchy: orchestrator delegates to specialists
- Memory continuity: agents remember across sessions via MEMORY.md
- Each agent has their own workspace, skills, and domain knowledge

### 4. Lessons Learned
- Personas need guardrails (an agent "in character" can go too far)
- Balance personality with utility — helpful first, entertaining second
- Users project more trust onto named agents than anonymous ones
- The orchestrator pattern: one agent to rule them all

### 5. Build Your Own Team
- How to think about agent specialization for your use case
- Start with 2-3 agents, not 10
- The minimum viable persona: name + role + tone + boundaries
- CTA: Try Agora to set up your own themed team

## Brand Voice Notes
- Fun, personality-forward — this is the "vibe" piece
- Show the character, don't just describe it
- Include actual quotes/examples from agents being in character
- Self-aware humor: "Yes, our CFO is a Greek hero. It works."
