## Hook

Most people interact with AI through disposable chat windows. Copy-paste workflows, lost context, zero continuity. What if your AI agents had a permanent home — a place where they remember, collaborate, and actually get work done?

## Outline

### 1. The Problem: Chat Windows Are Dead Ends
- AI conversations vanish after closing the tab
- No persistent memory, no team coordination
- You repeat yourself constantly — context is expensive
- The gap between "AI demo" and "AI that actually runs your business"

### 2. What Changes When Agents Have a Home
- Persistent memory across sessions (they remember you)
- Multiple specialized agents, each with a domain (not one generic chatbot)
- Background work: cron jobs, heartbeats, proactive check-ins
- Native desktop integration: notifications, hotkeys, always accessible

### 3. The Multi-Agent Model
- Why one AI isn't enough — specialization beats generalization
- Themed teams: your CTO agent shouldn't also be your fitness coach
- Orchestration: a lead agent delegates to specialists
- Real-world analogy: you don't hire one person to do everything

### 4. What This Looks Like in Practice
- Morning brief from your CEO agent summarizing priorities
- Marketing agent drafting content while you sleep
- Finance agent flagging invoice anomalies
- All coordinated through a single native app

### 5. CTA
- Introduce Agora as the answer to this problem
- Link to launch page / waitlist
